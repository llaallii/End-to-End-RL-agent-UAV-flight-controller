%% Tips:
%% - Use 'after X' for dependencies
%% - Use 'crit' tag for critical path: :crit, a1, 2026-02-01, 3d
%% - Use 'active' for current tasks: :active, b1, ...
%% - Use 'done' for completed: :done, a1, ...
%% - Use 'milestone' for gates: :milestone, m1, after a4, 0d
%% - Keep sections organized by phase, team, or workstream
%% - Date format must match dateFormat setting
