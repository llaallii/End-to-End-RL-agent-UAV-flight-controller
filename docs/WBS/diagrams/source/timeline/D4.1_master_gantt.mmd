%% Timeline Summary:
%% - Total Duration: ~35-45 weeks (8.5-11 months)
%% - Critical Path: Dynamics Model → PID → Training → Inference → Hardware → Testing
%% - Long lead items: PCB fabrication (3 weeks external)
%% - Training time is variable (2-6 weeks per iteration)
%% - Stage gates enforce quality transitions
